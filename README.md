## Introduction

### Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model using linear regression to predict the number of orders a retail company will receive. Accurately predicting orders allows the company to optimize its inventories, improve production planning, and ensure better customer service.

### Methodology

To achieve the project goal, we will follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
- We will collect historical order data from the store company, including information such as order date, product type, quantity ordered, and other relevant variables (e.g., promotions, holidays).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- We will perform a detailed analysis of the data to identify patterns, trends, and potential relationships between variables. This will include data visualization, calculating descriptive statistics, and identifying outliers.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
- We will clean and transform the data to prepare it for modeling. This may include imputing missing values, normalizing variables, and creating new derived features.

4. **Model Selection:**
- We will use linear regression as the primary model for this project. Linear regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

5. **Model Training:**
- We will split the data into training and test sets. We will train the linear regression model using the training set and tune the parameters to minimize the prediction error.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
- We will evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE) and Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²). This will allow us to measure the accuracy of the model's predictions.
